As I mentioned in my last post, the silver lining of COVID-19 is how it's bringing us together in new ways. However, it may be difficult to find those new ways with limited interaction. So, here's a list of things we can do to help each other!

**Donate a school meal**\
Many children rely on their schools to get their breakfast and lunch. Now that they're closed, donation centers like [No Kid Hungry ](https://www.nokidhungry.org/)are dishing out the meals these children need. You can also donate food through [Island Harvest](https://www.islandharvest.org/) and [Long Island Cares](https://www.licares.org/).

**Turn your trash into tresure\
**Also mentioned in the last post, this is an opportunity to welcome change and that means letting go of our old junk. As the saying goes though, one man's trash is another man's tresure, so don't throw it all away! Donation centers like [Savers, ](https://www.savers.com/covid-19)[Vietnam Veterans of America, ](http://www.vvapickup.org/)and [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/stories/how-habitat-continuing-pursue-our-mission-during-covid-19) are currently closed but will be accepting donations again ASAP so hold on to those items for a little longer. If you can't wait that long, check community Facebook groups or share your items on [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) or [Letgo](https://www.letgo.com/). You can then coordinate with buyers, traders, or anyone who will take that damn thing out of your home while still practicing social distancing. 3 cheers for recycling!

**Retail therapy**\
Thats right! According to The Washington Post, small businesses in are responsible for almost half of America's employment and for 99% of her employers. That's a lot of people and shopping locally helps keep them all working. Not to mention, small businesses generate 44% of US economic activity. So essentially, you're saving the economy and the world by online shopping mom and pop shops. Go you.

**Connect with your library**\
Did you know that libraries are for more than just reading and being shushed by grumpy librarians? They offer everything from yoga and cooking classes to arts and crafts for the kids to Anime viewings and [story time](https://www.facebook.com/MsNicolesStorytime/). And now, many are offering [their programs online](https://copiaguelibrary.org/) with live streams through Facebook, Zoom, and YouTube. You can even [download e-books and access streaming services](https://smithlib.org/stay-home-with-the-smithtown-library.html) for free using your library card.

**Family bonding**\
It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye. Be it from the official Red Ryder carbine action two-hundred shot range model air rifle, or a fight between the kids, tolerating our loved once can be a challenge. Luckily, there's about a million ides for crafts and activities on websites like [Pinterest ](https://www.pinterest.com/)and [MEL Science](https://melscience.com/US-en/) to keep everyone entertained and engaged in learning about the world around them and each other. Want an even simpler idea? Comedian Vic DiBitetto suggested teaching your loved ones life's basics. Things like cooking and sewing which many kids don't learn in school anymore. Don't know how to cook or sew? Pull up a YouTube channel and learn together! Have a passion for crochet? Drawing? Writing? Wine? Teach it! But maybe save the wine for those 21 and older...Need a break? Share (or maybe keep this for yourself) a DIY spa day for when you all just want a bit of quiet.
