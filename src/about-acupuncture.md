# About Acupuncture



<img src="/images/acupuncturepoints_1.jpg" alt="acupuncture chart"  class="float-left mr-8"/> 

​
Acupuncture is the insertion of fine needles into strategic points on the body to achieve overall wellness. This technique developed over 3,000 years ago and takes a holistic approach to healing. All the symptoms that you're feeling come down to one root diagnosis: an imbalance between internal organs, and/or pathology that has made it's way into your body. Acupuncture works to correct these imbalances and pathologies by supporting your body's natural ability to heal itself.

You and I are a team. That means that you have as big a role in your healing as I do. Think of it this way: you want to go to the supermarket but there's been a hurricane and there are tree branches blocking your path. What do you do? Call the town, they remove the branches, and then you can travel to the supermarket. Your heath is no different. You have your goal in health, you call your friendly neighborhood acupuncturist, I help remove the obstacles in your path, but you must travel on that path to obtain your goal. Your health is your responsibility, and your healthcare team is here to support you.

## What to expect

Your initial visit with me will run from 1.5-2 hours. That might sound crazy but it's because I do a very detailed intake. I want to learn your whole life story so I can better understand where you are now and how I can help you.

Follow-up visits are usually about 1 hour. We'll talk about how the previous treatment went, how you're feeling today, and the get the run down of all your bodily functions. And when I say all, I mean ALL. Get used to talking about poop. 
Follow-up visits for Facial Acupuncture will generally take about an 1.5 hours as there are extra steps that are taken to treat your skin.

Within every treatment, I will also look at your tongue and feel your pulses. This will tell me what's going on internally and explain why you're feeling the way you're feeling. This is also what informs my diagnosis and treatment plan. Also note that your treatment isn't limited to needling. Acupuncturists also use moxabustion, cupping, gua sha, electrical stimulation, liniments, dietary and lifestyle counseling, and many more techniques to provide a treatment unique to you and how you heal.

Come in something comfortable, bring an open mind, take a deep breath, and relax. I'll be with you every step of the way.

## Finding the Right Acupuncturist

​Whether you are in physical or emotional pain, facing a life threatening illness or simply want to keep yourself balanced, acupuncture can help. It is important to understand, however, that there are many different styles and needling techniques that are layered with the practitioner's own style and qi (energy) to create a treatment. If something isn't working, don't blame acupuncture. Finding the right acupuncturist is like finding the right medication and dose, you have to keep trying until you find what jives with you.
