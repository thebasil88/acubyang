During the Snow Pas de Deux, I stood up, pointed to the stage and yelled, "I want to be that\! But without him because I don't need his help." Needless to say, my mom signed me up for dance classes and when I was 10, I made the decision to completely dedicate myself to ballet as a student of the Frank Ohman School of Ballet. When I was 14, I was diagnosed with bursitis in both of my hips. After a stint with physical therapy and anti-inflammatories failed, I was told that if I wanted to be pain free, I'd have to quit dancing. That wasn't going to happen. This was when my mom suggested [acupuncture](/about-acupuncture/). Pretty nervous (and skeptical), I went. After several treatments I started improving, and then improving exponentially. I went from hardly being able to walk without pain, to dancing my heart out again. Surely enough, I became Snow Queen and learned very quickly that I do in fact need his help.

When it came time to pick a major in college I immediately chose biology. I knew I wanted to be in a medical field but there are so many incredible opportunities to choose from. Again, my mom's advice led me to acupuncture. I started talking to my acupuncturist and discovered that I could do so much more than treat pain. Once he started describing the theory, I was hooked.

After receiving my associates in biology, I attended the Tri-State College of Acupuncture in Manhattan and earned my Masters of Science in Acupuncture. There I learned the unique style of Acupuncture Physical Medicine ([Trigger Point Dry Needling](/trigger-point-dry-needling/)) in addition to Traditional Chinese Medicine, Traditional Japanese Acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping and gua sha. After that, I completed a course in Classical Chinese Medicine under the mentorship of Timothy Aitken; a master practitioner in the teaching lineage of Jeffery Yuen and specialist in pediatric acupuncture. I've also completed training in [Facial Acupuncture](/facial-acupuncture/) with Michelle Gellis.

What I've learned in acupuncture school influenced my ballet technique, and my dancing provides me with a deep understanding of the body. I have learned through both that what's emotional becomes visceral and the body is what tells the story - *your* story. With this combined knowledge, I offer a unique treatment style that blends the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual parts to see each patient as a whole being. My ultimate goal is to teach my patients how to be well through every level, not just how to manage their superficial symptoms.
